# 3d-printing-defects-classification

Project for Computer Vision course.

It consists in a convolutional network that is able to determine the defectiveness or otherwise of a 3D printing from an image.

The model that is generated is saved locally on one's own computer. In addition, I have implemented the possibility of modifying the 'technical' parameters of the model via the command line (plus other things), without having to put a hand in the code.

Finally, there is the actual evaluation part, i.e. an evaluation in percentage and textual terms will be produced from an image.

### Documentation

- Project Presentation.pdf
- Software.pdf: has more information about the software to run this code

### Images

- 3d (folder): the image dataset to create the model
- classification-images (folder): the image folder to test your model, load your photo here!

### Project

- Libraries (folder): container for the other files
- classification.py: the main file to run the code
- model.py: contain the code for model generation
