If you want to generate a new model with another parameter, open your folder project with your IDE,
you will have your command line at this position:

yourpath\3d-printer-recognition>

Now write for example on the command line:  

python ./Project/classification.py --epochs 3

So you will have this situation:

yourpath\3d-printer-recognition>python ./Project/classification.py --epochs 3

In this particular example, you will change ONLY the epochs number, the others remain the same.

Another example:

python ./Project/classification.py --image_path_file './Project\\test\\8.jpg'

in this case you can change the default test image classification, for example using 8.jpg image.
